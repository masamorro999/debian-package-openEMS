Summary of most noticeable changes for version 0.0.31:
-----------------------------------------------------
  - nf2ff: calculate circular polarization
  - improvements to calcPort
  - allow 1D and 2D lumped ports
  - improvements to SAR calculations
  - curve primitives and port fixes & improvements
  - FDTD operator now supports different material averaging methods
  - support for full multi-polar Lorentz/Drude/Debye dispersive material types
  - new ports for waveguides (rectangular and circular waveguides)
  - improved PEC debugging
  - improvements/simplifications in plotting far-fields (thanks to Stefan)
  - new tutorials and examples
  - many fixes and updates

Summary of most noticeable changes for version 0.0.30:
-----------------------------------------------------
  - meshing improved with new detect edges and new smoothing capabilities
  - new calcPort function for simplified port analysis
  - cylindrical mesh improvement by considering 360Â° rotation symmetry
  - support for harminv on all platforms
  - update to auto-regressive model for voltage/current probes
  - new SAR calculation options, incl. 1g/10g averaging
  - support for a new primitive: polyhedron
  - CAD import: STL/PLY surface solids supported (matlab: ImportSTL / ImportPLY)
  - CAD export: STL/PLY export (using AppCSXCAD)
  - lot of minor fixes and updates

Summary of most noticeable changes for version 0.0.29:
-----------------------------------------------------
  - Cylindrical sub-grids now fully support alpha-graded meshes
  - Property Electrode has been renamed to Excitation
      This doesn't have any effect on the Matlab/Octave interface,
      but old *.xml files cannot be run with a current openEMS/CSXCAD version.
  - Overall memory usage reduced during pre-processing
  - New excitation: Total-field/scattered field (TFSF)
  - New tutorial on radar cross section on a metallic sphere using the TFSF excitation
  - official support for 64-bit windows version
  - check for engine extensions MPI compatibility
  - CSXCAD: support for new CSXGeomPlot export options (see help for more infos)

To run the demo, first install and configure matlab or octave, CSXCAD, openEMS and hyp2mat. 
Copy the tutorial files to a directory where you have read and write access.
Start up matlab or octave from that directory, and type 'tutorial_hyp2mat'.
When the AppCSXCAD window appears, exit AppCSXCAD.
After a few minutes simulation output should appear.

The eagle subdirectory contains two sample boards, created with Cadsoft Eagle.

The boards were exported from Eagle to HyperLynx format using hyperlynx.ulp, a script in Eagle User Language.

The hyperlynx.ulp script used can be downloaded from http://www.cadsoftusa.com/downloads/ulps?language=en

To export a bord in hyperlynx format, in Eagle first run "ratsnest" then "run hyperlynx".

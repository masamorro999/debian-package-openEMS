This is a utility which converts HyperLynx files to CSXCAD for electromagnetic simulation.

Tested on Linux ubuntu, MacOSX and Windows/MingW.

Dependencies: requires libhpdf, libpng, zlib.

Default is installing the hyp2mat executable only.
If you wish to install not only the executable, but also the hyp2mat library, includes and package information, add the "--enable-library" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library"

Default is building the static libhyp2mat.a library only.
If you wish to build not only the static library, but also the shared libhyp2mat.so library, add the "--enable-shared" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library --enable-shared"

The following packages are necessary for development: g++, libtool, make, bison, flex, gengetopt, help2man, groff, ps2pdf.

On Linux ubuntu, with libhpdf installed in /usr/lib:
  sh ./bootstrap.sh
  ./configure
  make 
  make install

On MacOSX, with libhpdf installed in /opt/local using MacPorts:
  sh ./bootstrap.sh
  CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib ./configure
  make 
  make install

On Windows:

  Install MinGW (http://www.mingw.org)
  Compile zlib, libpng and libharu (libhpdf):

  zlib-1.2.8:
  INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib BINARY_PATH=/usr/bin make -f win32/Makefile.gcc  install
  
  libpng-1.5.17:
  CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/ ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install
  
  libharu-2.2.1:
  Download libharu-2.2.1-png15.patch from http://sisyphus.ru/en/srpm/Sisyphus/libharu/patches/0
  Patch libharu, configure and install: 
  patch -p0 < libharu-2.2.1-png15.patch
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install

  Compile hyp2mat as a static binary: 
  
  hyp2mat:
  CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include LDFLAGS="-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -L/usr/lib" ./configure
  make
  make install
